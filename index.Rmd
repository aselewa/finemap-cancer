This is the page for the cancer-germline project. Below are links to analyses.

I ran S-LDSC on annotations from ENCODE, Roadmap, TCGA, and other papers.

* [Enrichment Analyses](s-ldsc_enrichment.html) (03/09/2020)

Annotations were merged into broad categories (immune histones, immune open chromatin, etc.). Torus was ran to estimate prior probabilities per SNP. SuSiE was ran with L = 1. SuSiE was also ran with no prior probability, and the resulting PIPs were compared below.
